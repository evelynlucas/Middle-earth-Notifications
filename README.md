# Middle-earth Notifications
Welcome to Middle-earth! This app showcases some of the major characters from Tolkien's legendarium. Once you click on a character, you are taken to a second Activity that shows a bigger image of the character, a short bio and a quote. Once you click on the notification button, you are sent a notification that says "One App To Rule Them All". If you click on the notification again for the same character, you are not permitted to send the notification again.
